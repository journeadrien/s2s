        section 1: "We first performed immunostaining of layer 5 pyramidal neurons of the rat prefrontal cortex to map the distribution of Na+ channel subtypes and the Na+ channel–associated protein ankyrin-G (AnkG), which is known to accumulate at the AIS (Fig. 1). We found a differential distribution of Nav1.2 and Nav1.6 at the proximal and distal AIS, respectively (Fig. 1a,b). Further immunostaining of 100-μm-thick sections showed a peak in the density of Nav1.6 channels between 30 and 50 μm from the soma (Supplementary Fig. 1), corresponding to the action potential initiation zone that was previously identified. To examine the density of total Na+ channels, we stained the AIS with a pan-alpha Na+ channel antibody (Pan-Nav), which recognizes both Nav1.2 and Nav1.6 channels."
        section 2: "Consistent with previous findings, we observed strong Pan-Nav immunoreactivity at the AIS, with a peak distribution between 10 and 20 μm (Fig. 1c), corresponding to the region of Nav1.2 accumulation. Although immunoreactivity was undetectable in the somatic membrane, electrophysiological recordings in the following experiments indicated that high-threshold Na+ channels were present in the soma (see below)."
